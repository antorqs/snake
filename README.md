SNAKE GAME
==========

Description
-----------

This is a clone of the popular Snake game. 

The purpose of the development of this game was to try and learn the features of PyGame as a game engine and library.


The Game
--------

The main goal is to eat the most fruits that appear on the garden. Every time the snake eats a fruit, it grows.
If the snake bumps into an obstacle (rock or wall) or its body, it'll die.
Also there are holes on the ground, and the snake may use them to 'move-like-teleport'.


Modes
-----

Story Mode: Three levels, each has a number of red fruits to be eaten.
Endless Mode: Eat as long as you can survive to set a new record.


Features
--------
Red Apple: Basic fruit, gives you 1 point.
Blue Apple: Specia fruit, gives you 3 points. Will disappear if not eaten in a short amount of time.

Holes: Holes on the ground that interconnect and allow the snake to travel like portals.
